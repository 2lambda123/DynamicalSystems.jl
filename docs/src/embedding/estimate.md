# Optimal DCE Parameters
This page discusses and provides algorithms for estimating optimal parameters to do Delay Coordinates Embedding (DCE) with.

The approaches can be grouped into two schools:
1. **Independent** (also called **traditional**), where one tries to independently find the best value for a delay time `œÑ` and an embedding dimension `d`.
2. **Unified**, where at the same time an optimal combination of `œÑ, d` is found.

The independent approach is something "old school", while recent scientific research has shifted almost exclusively to unified approaches.

In addition, the unified approaches are the only ones that can accommodate multi-variate inputs. This means that if you have multiple measured input timeseries, you should be able to take advantage of all of them for the best possible embedding of the dynamical system's set.

### Example
```@example MAIN
using DynamicalSystems, PyPlot

ds = Systems.roessler()
# This trajectory is a chaotic attractor with fractal dim ‚âà 2
# therefore the set needs at least embedding dimension of 3
tr = trajectory(ds, 1000.0; dt = 0.05)
x = tr[:, 1]

dmax = 7
fig = figure()
for (i, method) in enumerate(["afnn", "fnn", "f1nn", "ifnn"])
    # Plot statistic used to estimate optimal embedding
    # as well as the automated output embedding
    ùíü, œÑ, E = optimal_traditional_de(x, method; dmax)
    plot(1:dmax, E; label = method, marker = "o", ms = 5, color = "C$(i-1)")
    optimal_d = size(ùíü, 2)
    scatter(optimal_d, E[optimal_d]; marker = "s", s = 100, color = "C$(i-1)")
end
